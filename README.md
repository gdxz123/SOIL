# SOIL

## Introduction:

 SOIL is a tiny C library used primarily for uploading textures into OpenGL. It is based on stb_image version 1.16, the public domain code from Sean Barrett (found [here](https://github.com/nothings/stb) ). I have extended it to load TGA and DDS files, and to perform common functions needed in loading OpenGL textures. SOIL can also be used to save and load images in a variety of formats (useful for loading height maps, non-OpenGL applications, etc.)

## Download: 

 You can grab the latest version of SOIL [here](http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html).
